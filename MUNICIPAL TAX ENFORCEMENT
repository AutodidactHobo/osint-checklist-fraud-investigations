Water/Sewer Billing Systems (internal)	Active services often prove residency
Trash Collection or Permit Records	Name attached to ongoing municipal service
FOIA to DMV or Vehicle Registration	Tag/address cross-check if legally permissible

State Business Registry	Self-employed? Track LLCs, DBAs, or partnerships
ZoomInfo (if available)	Confirm employment metadata
Court Records	Look for wage garnishments or employment-related filings

PACER	Bankruptcy, civil judgments, tax disputes
CourtListener	Free access to many PACER cases
State Judiciary Portals	Civil suits, collections, landlord-tenant issues

STEP 6: Digital Footprint & Location Clues
Tool	Use
Facebook / Instagram	Vacation pics, “checked in” locations, family ties
Wayback Machine	Old web pages tied to personal businesses
Hunter.io	See if personal domain has been used for email
WHOIS	Domain tied to a debtor who may claim no assets
Google Dorking	"Name" + "cell" OR "email" OR "invoice" can yield gold

Goal: Uncover signs of activity, spending, or travel that suggest recoverable assets.
