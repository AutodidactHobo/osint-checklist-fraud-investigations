COMBINATIONS OF TOOLS FOR MAXIMUM INVESTIGATIVE IMPACT

1. Shell Company + Domain Metadata Correlation
Objective: Detect hidden control, fake entities, or ghost vendors.

Tool Chain:
OpenCorporates ‚Üí to identify registered entities and directors
WHOIS + SecurityTrails ‚Üí to find domain registration email/IP and changes over time
Hunter.io ‚Üí to confirm internal email schema matches domain claims
Wayback Machine ‚Üí to compare the current website with prior versions

Why it works: Real businesses evolve their web presence. Ghost vendors often have inconsistent or rapidly thrown-together websites, recently registered domains, and zero web history.

2. Beneficial Ownership + Political Influence Discovery
Objective: Spot hidden conflicts of interest or corruption exposure.

Tool Chain:
FinCEN BO Registry ‚Üí to identify controlling parties
OpenSecrets + FEC.gov ‚Üí to check for political donations, PAC ties
FARA.gov ‚Üí to identify undeclared foreign lobbying
LinkedIn ‚Üí to validate employment history of owners or board members

Why it works: Shell companies are often used to launder influence. If a vendor‚Äôs hidden owner is making campaign donations or lobbying, that's a compliance red flag.

3. Litigation Mapping via Entity/Executive Targeting
Objective: Reveal undisclosed legal risk, fraud allegations, or judgment history.

Tool Chain:
OpenCorporates ‚Üí gather all affiliated entities
PACER + CourtListener ‚Üí search across entities and executives
Trellis Law or local court sites ‚Üí for state-level claims
Google Dork ‚Üí "Vendor Name" + "lawsuit" OR "judgment" OR "settlement"

Why it works: Fraudsters often ‚Äúburn‚Äù one LLC and spin up another. Tracing shared directors via court records uncovers their litigation trail.

4. Procurement / Contracting Risk Mapping
Objective: Detect favoritism, bid-rigging, or political contracts.

Tool Chain:
SAM.gov + USAspending.gov ‚Üí to find federal contract awards
OpenSecrets ‚Üí to match donations with contract award periods
OpenCorporates + Wayback Machine ‚Üí to see if vendor was formed shortly before contract
CourtListener ‚Üí to check for award disputes

Why it works: Shell vendors created shortly before awards, especially with donation trails, signal procurement fraud risk.

5. Person-to-Entity Linkage (Conflict or Collusion Detection)
Objective: Prove connection between employee and vendor (e.g., kickback scheme)

Tool Chain:
Pipl or That‚ÄôsThem ‚Üí to match addresses/emails/phones
LinkedIn ‚Üí to identify dual roles, prior affiliations
County GIS Records ‚Üí to trace shared ownership of property
OpenCorporates ‚Üí to find if an employee or relative owns a vendor

Why it works: Fraud frequently hides in personal associations. These chains expose shared fingerprints that violate procurement policy.

üõ†6. Sanctions/Evasion Pattern Mapping
Objective: Discover if a vendor is laundering sanctioned entities through intermediaries.

Tool Chain:
OFAC List + UN Sanctions ‚Üí for known entity names
WHOIS ‚Üí for domain registration in suspect regions
OpenCorporates ‚Üí to reveal registration in secrecy havens
ICIJ Offshore Leaks + OCCRP Aleph ‚Üí to find leaked links

Why it works: Shells often obfuscate control through layers. Matching a vendor‚Äôs founder to known OFAC aliases or sanctioned intermediaries is a kill shot.

7. Ghost Vendor or Thin Presence Detection
Objective: Determine if a vendor is real, operational, and capable.

Tool Chain:
Wayback Machine ‚Üí to see if the vendor site was live before the contract
LinkedIn ‚Üí to check if employees exist
Glassdoor + Yelp ‚Üí to verify business activity
ZoomInfo or Clearbit (if available) ‚Üí for team structure
Hunter.io ‚Üí for actual domain usage or catch-all email setup

Why it works: Real businesses leave a footprint. A shell vendor created solely to receive payments will lack any real presence or staff.
